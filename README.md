### Setup
#### VSCode
1. Setup diffrent configurations for [launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) and [task.json](.vscode/tasks.json) to build, run and debug normal active file and unit test file since the `program` path of Unity test framework is different from normal c.
2. Make sure use latest version of Ruby as older version might cause problem on ceedling.
3. Refer [here](https://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling) for installing ceedling. And [here](https://github.com/jxwleong/HowToCreateCeedlingProject) for how to create a project and module using ceedling.
